# Connecting a PIR Motion Sensor

Before booting your Raspberry Pi, connect the PIR module to the Raspberry Pi.

Using three female-to-female jumper cables, you'll need to connect each of the PIR sensor's connectors to the appropriate pins on the Raspberry Pi.

Connect the top one labelled `VCC` on the PIR sensor to the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi, connect the middle one labelled `OUT` to GPIO pin 4, and connect the bottom one labelled `GND` to a ground pin also marked `GND`. All shown in the following diagram:

Now boot your Pi and log in.
