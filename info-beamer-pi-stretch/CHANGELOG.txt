Version 0.9.8-beta [2017-08-14] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.8

 * Updated luajit to v2.1 beta3
 * resource.open_file now accepts an 'openfile' object
   as argument. This is essentially the same as calling
   filename_argument:copy()
 * load_image now has an additional 'nearest' option
   to use GL_NEAREST sampling instead of GL_LINEAR.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   'type' now returns the proper type name for all
   info-beamer objects instead of the previous 'userdata'
   response. If you have relied upon the 'userdata'
   value, you'll have to update your code.

Version 0.9.7-beta [2017-04-05] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.7

 * Fixed support for kernel > 4.4. No more "cannot read
   serial" errors.
 * Raw videos can still be modified if playback was
   completed.
 * Allow 'node.alias "*"' that will let the node
   catch all incoming packets.
 * Show a warning if the filesystem of the node is not
   a supported filesystem (like e.g. NFS).
 * Warn about the known HDMI/audio firmware bug.
   See README.txt

Version 0.9.6-beta [2016-07-25] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.6

 * Updated luajit to 972a1a4c. This update solves a
   problem introduced in mid may which is fixed in
   c98660c8.

Version 0.9.5-beta [2016-07-18] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.5

 * added node.make_nested() which enables notifications
   of child node content/child activity using the
   content_update, content_remove, child_update and
   child_remove events. It also enables loading of
   resources in nested folders.
 * Added utility function util.noglobals() which,
   once called, prevents reading and writing of
   undefined global variables.
 * More debug information in log level 3/4.
 * Fixed minimal flickering that sometimes occured
   when starting info-beamer.
 * os.time() now returns the unix timestamp as a
   floating point value with millisecond precision.
 * Better explanation when info-beamer gets stuck.
   This can be used to detect if the pi firmware
   crashed and a system reboot is required.
 * Added experimental INFOBEAMER_GLOBAL_VSYNC
 * Added :source / :alpha to raw_videos
 * shader uniform values can be booleans.
 * Added IPv6 support. By default info-beamer will
   listen to 127.0.0.1 and ::1.
 * Fixed a bug that might sometimes result in wrong
   arguments given to gl.rotate/scale/transform if
   the lua jit compiler inlined those functions.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   info-beamer now detects files and directories
   in a defined order: directories sorted
   by name, all files except node.lua sorted by
   filename and finally node.lua.
   This change shouldn't have any impact on your
   code, as the order in which files where detected
   was previously random, so relying on a specific
   order would be a bug anyway.

Version 0.9.4-beta [2015-11-30] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.4

 * Added versions for both raspbian jessie and
   raspbian wheezy.
 * Added resource tracking to make it easier to
   find object leaks. To see the loaded object list
   send info-beamer a SIGUSR1 signal.
 * Added back hardware accelerated jpeg decoding.
   By default it is only enabled on the PI1 for
   larger baseline JPEGs. You can use
   INFOBEAMER_HW_JPEG to force or disable this
   feature. See info-beamer -h
 * Fixed raw video playback not starting when
   using audio.
 * Fixed a problem for some video files that
   got temporarily stuck when auto looping them.
 * Downsample audio to stereo. Previously some
   audio formats wouldn't properly play. This adds
   a new runtime dependency, that probably already
   installed. See README.txt (Installation) for
   details. In the future real support for more
   than 2 channels will be added.
 * stack tracebacks now include documentation links
   for info-beamer builtins.
 * Disable keyboard input so starting in the
   background from a shell (using &) works now.
   Note that starting info-beamer that way is probably
   not a good idea. To run info-beamer have a
   look at https://info-beamer.com/lnk/running
 * Video size is now determined by the decoder.
   Playing streamed video content now works better
   since the size often isn't available when
   starting to read a stream.
 * Added experimental features that might improve
   texture uploading. See info-beamer -h

Version 0.9.3-beta [2015-09-21] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.3

 * Fixed a bug in the video pipeline. Pausing and
   restarting a video now pauses audio.
 * added *query/*nodes tcp command to query loaded
   nodes. Requires INFOBEAMER_CMD_NODES to be set,
   otherwise the returned list is empty.
 * Added support for multiple displays. You can now
   use INFOBEAMER_TARGET_D=lcd to output to a DSI
   connected display (like the official RPi display).
   Or INFOBEAMER_TARGET_D=tv to display on HDMI
   even if a DSI display is connected.

Version 0.9.2-beta [2015-08-27] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.2

 * Fixed a precision problem that occured when info-beamer
   was running for a long time. Visualizations should now
   be smooth no matter how long they are running.
 * Slightly improved font rendering performance.
 * You can now use tvservice -o / tvservice -p to
   turn the screen off while info-beamer is running.
   It will try to restore the output once you turn
   the screen back on. This only works when the
   resolution stays the same.

Version 0.9.1-beta [2015-06-28] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.1

 * Fixed video playback error that might lead to info-beamer
   getting stuck.

Version 0.9.0-beta [2015-06-11] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.9.0

 * Reworked the video subsystem. It now supports
   starting paused (so preloading videos and then
   running them at an exact time is possible now).
 * Videos now support seamless looping.
 * Added a way to play video completely outside
   of the normal OpenGL pipeline. This can be
   used for a perfectly smooth playback for FullHD
   videos. Learn more about this feature at
   https://info-beamer.com/lnk/rawvideo
 * info-beamer now uses a new way to hide the background
   behind the output generated by info-beamer. This might
   free up resources and memory bandwidth for complicated
   setups. See https://info-beamer.com/lnk/blank
   If you want to restore the previous behaviour, use
   INFOBEAMER_BLANK_MODE=layer
 * Exposed the luajit compiler. So you can use
   info-beamer to precompile your node.lua into
   binary bytecode without installing luajit.
 * The "connect" event provides the optional node
   suffix provided when connecting as a second
   argument now. So you can dispatch to different
   endpoints in the "connect" event.
 * It is now possible to disconnect TCP clients
   from within lua using node.client_disconnect.
 * All functions that previously required a filename
   argument now also accept the new openfile object.
   Those objects capture a file when they are created.
   Later using that openfile object when loading a
   resource will still work even if the underlying
   file was deleted from the filesystem.
   See https://info-beamer.com/lnk/openfile
 * Show more debug information when print'ing objects.
 * info-beamer now by default binds to 127.0.0.1
   instead of 0.0.0.0. So by default your info-beamer
   process is not reachable over the network. Use
   INFOBEAMER_ADDR=0.0.0.0 to restore the previous
   behaviour.
 * Support GLSL shader arrays. Tables with 2-4
   elements are still available as vec{2|3|4}. Tables
   with more elements (up to 1024) as available
   as an array. Note that you don't have to send an
   unchanged array each frame. Values persist between
   frames.
 * Images and GL videos can now display subareas of
   their texture using the draw call. Four optional
   additional parameters specify the top-left and
   bottom-right corner. Default is 0, 0, 1, 1 which
   draws the complete texture:
   image:draw(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)
 * gl.perspective takes two optional parameters that
   can be used to create a perspective projection that
   isn't centered on the screen.
 * Added support for OSC bundle messages and the
   OSC string data type.
 * Rotate through log levels using SIGUSR2
 * require will now also try to load modules from the
   file luabundle.zip. You can use this file to
   store required modules so they don't pollute
   the filesystem. Nested directories are supported
   inside the zip, so you can use standard module
   layout.
 * Allow empty node alias. The node with the empty
   alias will get all messages/connections that don't
   match any other node path/alias.
 * Added os.time/os.date functions. Using them is
   discouraged. For testing and better timezone
   support it is almost always better to externally
   provide time using info-beamers great scriptability.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   Unified the vertical orientation of almost all
   textures, so inside shaders 0, 0 is now actually in
   the top left corner. If you have previously used
   shaders you might have to change the way you use
   TexCoord.y. Contact me if you need help with that.

Version 0.8.3-beta [2015-03-05] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.8.3

 * Now uses libjpeg-turbo. This will result in faster
   load times for JPEG files on all PI versions. On the
   new Pi 2, it will use NEON instructions to speed things
   up even more.
 * Video playback now uses two buffers by default to
   prevent screen tearing. This increases the amount
   of GPU memory required to play back videos. So the
   recommended minimum GPU memory is now 192MB. Please
   see README.txt on how to set the reserved memory size.
   If you want the old behaviour back, you can set
   INFOBEAMER_NO_VIDEO_DOUBLEBUFFER=1
 * Now detects pressed keys while the program is running.
   Hitting escape (while the terminal that is running
   info-beamer still has focus) now quits info-beamer.
 * Added INFOBEAMER_SWAP_INTERVAL. This allows you to
   control at which screen refresh rate interval the
   current surface is blit to the screen. See the
   release link above for more information.
 * Added an endless loop/stuck detection. Once detected,
   info-beamer will try to get a traceback, so you know
   where to fix the problem. The info-beamer process
   will then terminate with an error.
 * Added the ability to export the embedded userlib.lua,
   so you can see what's going on. Use the new command
   line ./info-beamer -d userlib.lua to export it.
   See the embedded comments for more information on
   what you can do with it.
 * Added bit module support. See http://bitop.luajit.org/
 * New pretty printer for debugging. Example output: pp(_G)
 * util.auto_loader now embraces async loading: It only
   updates the target value once the resource is loaded.
   So when you use rename to atomically move in a new
   image, the previously loaded image will remain available
   while the new image is being loaded. During initial
   loading of an async resource a dummy transparent pixel
   is provided.
 * Fixed a crash bug that was triggered by calling
   node.client_write without arguments.
 * Fixed a minor (72bytes/playback) resource leak then
   playing videos.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   Removed functions table.show, table.filter and table.keys.
   They were undocumented in the past and are no longer
   available. Of course you can implement them yourself
   easily if you used them. Contact me, if you need help.

Version 0.8.2-beta [2015-02-13] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.8.2

 * Now runs on the Raspberry PI 2.
 * Changes in how garbage collection is handled. See
   https://info-beamer.com/lnk/gc for more information.
 * More functions now fail with lua errors when you run
   out of arm/gpu memory instead of failing silently.
 * Fixed compatibilities with the new Raspberry PI 2
   userland/kernel.
 * Switched to a new cross compiled build system which
   might enable more optimizations in the future.
 * Closed some rarely occuring memory leaks.
 * Fixed text not being properly rendered sometimes while
   starting a node.
 * Optimized render path to avoid sending GL commands
   that don't change the current GL state.
 * You can now query for uncaught node errors using
   TCP. Connect to info-beamer and use
   *query/*error/<node-path>. See the updated python client:
   https://github.com/info-beamer/tools/tree/master/ibquery
   If you're only interested if there was an error (and not
   it's actual message), you can use
   *query/*has_error/<node-path>.
   From inside lua you can reset the global error flag
   using node.reset_error().
 * You can use a new environment variable
   INFOBEAMER_OUTSIDE_SOURCES=1 to allow info-beamer to
   read files from outside the node directories. Using
   this feature is strongly discouraged as it makes it
   more difficult to keep your node code modular.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   resource.load_image is now asynchronous by default. So
   loading images no longer blocks rendering. This also
   means that image:size() is not immediately available
   after calling resource.load_image. You have to probe
   image:state() to get the current loading progress.
   Feedback is appreciated.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   sys.set_flag and sys.client_write were moved to
   node.set_flag and node.client_write since they work
   on node scope and not system scope. They will still
   be inside the sys table till at least version 0.9.

Version 0.8.1-beta [2015-01-21] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.8.1

 * Optimized internal handling of shaders and default shader
   setup. This might give you a huge performance boost.
 * Optimized the way the Lua API is called. Might give you
   a slight performance boost.
 * Added profiler support. Use the new INFOBEAMER_PROFILE
   environment variable to enable profiling.
 * Fonts now use kerning. It's enabled by default. If your
   output suffers for some reason you can disable kerning
   by setting the environment variable INFOBEAMER_NO_KERNING=1
 * Switched to luajit 2.1
 * Removed contrib directory. All tools are available on
   https://github.com/info-beamer/tools
 * Reworked console output. There is less output in the
   default setting now. Use the new INFOBEAMER_LOG_LEVEL
   environment variable to change the log level. Setting
   it to 3 restores the previous quite noisy output.
 * Bundled utf8 support library.

Version 0.8.0-beta [2014-10-11] https://info-beamer.com/lnk/0.8.0

 * Unused framebuffers (allocated when rendering child nodes)
   are now discarded earlier. This will leave more GPU memory
   or other resources.
 * New way of using the hardware surface. This will give you
   a 10% performance boost on average. As a side effect it
   also allows you to render the info-beamer top level node
   into a region on the screen. This is useful if you're
   using a frame grabber device of some kind that requires
   content in a certain region.
 * Added a way to snapshot sub regions when using
   resource.create_snapshot.
 * info-beamer content can now be fully transparent. So you
   can now draw over other raspberry PI layers. Use
   INFOBEAMER_TRANSPARENT=1 for that.
 * Added a way to make noise free 2-way conversions with
   your nodes using the TCP method. print no longer writes
   to all connected clients. Added a sys.client_write
   function to write to connected clients. See updated
   samples/parrot example.
 * Added *help command when connecting by TCP. It will
   show all available commands.
 * Added Raspberry PI frame grabber code to take screenshots.
   See contrib/frame.
 * Various minor (performance) fixes.
 * Updated luajit

Version 0.7.2-beta [2014-03-19]

 * Firmware from march 14th or newer will produce a
   flipped video output. This case is now handled by
   flipping the texture coordinates of the video texture.
 * Updated to luajit 2.0.3

Version 0.7.1-beta [2014-02-17]

 * Removed photos-fade example from samples directory. It wasn't
   meant to be included in the release. Please use the example in
   https://github.com/dividuum/info-beamer-nodes/ for an up to date
   version.
 * Show a warning if GPU memory provided seems too small.

Version 0.7-beta [2013-12-20]

 * Huge font rendering performance boost.
   Also deduplicates loaded fonts, so using
   the same font in multiple nodes only keeps
   them in memory once.
 * Included native json decoder. If you do
   require("json"), the native module will
   be loaded unless there is a local json.lua.
 * POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY:
   Prevented some functions from being
   called outside the node.render function, e.g.
   it's no longer possible to call font:write
   while the node is still initializing.

Version 0.6.3-beta [2013-11-30]

 * Fixed image loading bug during startup for images
   with a width not divisible by 4.

Version 0.6.2-beta [2013-11-22]

 * Fixed inotify race conditions that occur
   when rapidly updating directories.

Version 0.6.1-beta [2013-11-13]

 * Added experimental async image loading using
   resource.load_image_async
 * Dispatched background work into a fixed set of
   worker threads to prevent memory leaks that
   occur when using short lived threads.

Version 0.6-beta [2013-10-31]

 * Video playback, loading and unloading is now fully handled
   in a dedicated thread. This will hopefully prevent any
   stuttering while loading videos.
 * A running info-beamer can now be queried for various
   runtime values using a TCP connection. See the included
   file contrib/ibquery.py
 * Displays information on startup/runtime. This should make it
   easier to find problems in the future.

Version 0.5.1-beta [2013-07-05]

 * Increased the size of audio buffers. Needed for 48000hz
   audio playback.

Version 0.5-beta

 * Videos now support audio playback. Use

   util.videoplayer("file.mp4", {audio: true})

   to play a video with audio playback.

Version 0.4-beta

 * Fixed video looping when using util.videoplayer.

Version 0.3-beta

 * Error deduplication. Repeating errors are only printed once.

 * Fixed osc/data mapper
   Now works as intended: The callback function now receives all
   captures from a single match. Patterns without captures only
   receive the callback data.
